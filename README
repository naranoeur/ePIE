This is an parallel implementation of the cdi algorithm.
The program is split up into 3 classes. 
1. Data
	Either simulates the image or loads image
	data from a file
2. Cdi
	Takes the image initialized by Data class and
	applies cdi algorithm to it, to reconstruct
	the object
3. Output
	Takes the reconstructed object from Cdi class.
	Handles the saving and displaying of the 
	results.
	Must have GnuPlot and be on Linux/Mac system
	for the plotting utility to work.
The reason for this implementation is that above classes 
are contained wholes and can be made as complicated or
simple as the implementer needs/wants them to be. 

The GPU and CPU code is split up. The only class that
runs on GPU is Cdi.

External libraries used:
	- fftw - only class Data should have access
	- Gnuplot - only class Output should have access
	- OpenCV - only class Data should have access
